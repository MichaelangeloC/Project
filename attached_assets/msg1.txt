Thank you for the clear and direct response. I appreciate you addressing each point and confirming the current state of the implementation. It's very helpful to know where we stand relative to the 'Automated Job Application Development Plan.txt'.
Given your feedback and the priorities in the development plan, I'd like you to address the following areas, focusing on building the foundational elements correctly before moving to more complex AI integrations or UI features:
 * Improve Resume Parsing (Ref: Plan Section 2.4):
   * Please prioritize modifying app/resume_processor/parser.py to use pdfplumber for PDFs and python-docx for DOCX files, as specified in the plan. This will ensure more reliable text extraction, which is crucial for all downstream tasks. Ensure it still handles .txt files as well.
 * Implement Initial Programmatic Filtering (Ref: Plan Section 2.5):
   * After robust resume parsing is in place, the next priority is to implement the automated initial filtering logic. This function should take the list of standardized job data objects (from scanners) and the parsed resume data (specifically, the full text for now) as input.
   * It should filter based on:
     * Keywords: Simple matching of high-frequency terms from the resume's full text against the full_job_description_text.
     * Pay Grade: Compare pay_grade_string from job data (if present and easily parsable) against the user's TARGET_PAY_GRADE_MIN from the configuration.
     * Location: Basic string comparison of the job's location_string against the user's TARGET_LOCATION.
   * This filtering should occur before any detailed skill extraction or AI-driven matching to reduce the processing load, as per the plan's intention. The output of this step will be a smaller list of potentially relevant jobs.
 * Implement Detailed NLP Skill Extraction (Ref: Plan Section 3.1):
   * Once initial filtering is done, focus on app/resume_processor/analyzer.py (or a new SkillExtractor class as planned) to implement the NLP-powered skill extraction.
   * This involves using spaCy or NLTK for:
     * Text preprocessing (lowercase, remove punctuation, stop words, lemmatization) on both the resume text and the full_job_description_text of the filtered jobs.
     * Skill identification using techniques like Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging and matching against a predefined skill list.
   * The output should be a structured list of identified skills for the resume and for each filtered job description.
Addressing these three areas in this order will build a more robust foundation for the subsequent AI matching and tailoring tasks, and will also align more closely with the planned efficient pipeline.
Please proceed with improving Resume Parsing (Point 1) first. Let me know if you have any questions before you begin. And please continue to refer back to the 'Automated Job Application Development Plan.txt' for detailed guidance.
