Okay, thank you for addressing the pdfplumber issue and switching to PyPDF2 for PDF parsing. It's good to see the specialized file handling for PDF, DOCX, and TXT in place.
Yes, now that the resume parsing has been made more robust, please proceed with implementing the programmatic filtering functionality (Point 2 from my previous set of priorities).
As a reminder, this involves:
 * Creating a function that takes the list of standardized job data objects and the parsed full resume text.
 * Filtering jobs based on:
   * Keywords (simple matching of high-frequency resume terms against job description text).
   * Pay Grade (comparison with TARGET_PAY_GRADE_MIN from config).
   * Location (basic string comparison with TARGET_LOCATION from config).
 * This step should occur after scanning and before any detailed skill extraction or AI-driven matching.
Please refer to section 2.5 of the 'Automated Job Application Development Plan.txt' for the detailed requirements of this initial filtering logic. Let me know if anything is unclear before you start.
